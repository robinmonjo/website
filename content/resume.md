**Migration from home made PaaS to Kubernetes**

I lead the full adoption of Kubernetes at Eventmaker to migrate away from a home made PaaS that was difficult to maintain. The project resulted in:
- a much lower time spent on infrastructure work
- more robust and scalable infrastructure
- later, allowed us to benefit from the Kubernetes ecosystem

**Eventmaker Check-in app**

## Internships

#### Integration of LXC in a PaaS - 6 months in 2013 at Applidget (ex Eventmaker)
Keywords: `chroot`, `LXC`, `PaaS`, `IaaS`, `SaaS`, `cloud`, `Heroku`, `git`, `AWS`, `vagrant-up`, `Nodejs`, `Ruby`, `Rails`, `Go`, `virtualisation`, `container`, `isolation`, `buildpacks`, `Linux`, `Bash`, `Mongodb`, `Redis`, `AuFS`, `HTTP`, `REST`, `SSH`, `Upstart`, `Docker`, `High availability`, `portability`

The isolation of running applications used in production within a Platform as a Service (PaaS), is essential for two reasons: security and footprint control of processes over a system. Operating system level isolation allows a complete control of resources whether they are software or hardware. However, cloud-computing context doesn’t encourage the use of virtualisation, due to its cost in term of performance and budget. Linux containers (LXC) provide a lightweight and fast alternative to classic virtualisation.

To validate my Technical Degree in Computer Science, I had to carry out a training period of a minimum length of ten weeks. For my first experience, I decided to do that training period at the Laboratory of Informatics of Grenoble (LIG), more precisely in the Sigma team. This team focuses its research on Information Systems (IS). My training period aimed to develop a tool allowing computerizing a method used to build process meta­models for IS engineering.
This method, proposed by my supervisor, a PhD student, is based on a process domain meta­model, a conceptual graph and patterns. Those elements have been created to give method engineers the opportunity to easily build multi viewpoints process meta­models.
At the beginning of my training period, I studied the method and the specifications during a long time.
Then, I analysed different tools and technologies that could be useful for the implementation. After the requirements analysis period, I started to program with the Java language and the integrated development environment Eclipse.
The goal of my training period was to finish the first part of the tool, so I produced a significant documentation for the next developers including the technical and functional description of the tool.
